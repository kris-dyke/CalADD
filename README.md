# CalADD
A calendar improvement app for google calendar to make calendar events actually useful for those of us that could not remember an appointment if our life depended on it.  We can do this by utilizing the ringer or alarms to make an event notification supremely annoying and completely unvavoidable by the inattentive owner of the smart phone running this app.
